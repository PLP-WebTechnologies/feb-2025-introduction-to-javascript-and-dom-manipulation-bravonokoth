# Introduction to JavaScript and DOM Manipulation

## Objectives

Write basic JavaScript functions.
Manipulate the DOM dynamically.
Respond to user interactions.

## Instructions

- Create a script.js file and link it to a HTML.
- Structure the document using DOCTYPE, html, head, and body.

>[!NOTE]
>  - Write JavaScript that:
>  - Changes text content dynamically.
>  - Modifies CSS styles via JavaScript.
>  - Adds or removes an element when a button is clicked.


# Tasks
- Create a well-structured HTML5 document.
- Use at least 5 different HTML elements.
- Ensure semantic correctness.

## Implementation Details
The assignment has been completed with the following files:
- **`index.html`**:
  - A well-structured HTML5 document using DOCTYPE and semantic elements.
  - Includes 5+ HTML elements: `<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<footer>`, `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<p>`, and `<button>`.
  - Links to `script.js` for JavaScript functionality.
  - Contains inline CSS for basic styling.
- **`script.js`**:
  - Implements dynamic DOM manipulation:
    - Changes text content of a `<p>` element when a button is clicked.
    - Modifies CSS styles (color, font size, background, padding) of the text when a button is clicked.
    - Adds a new `<p>` element to a container when a button is clicked.
    - Removes the last added element when a button is clicked.
  - Uses event listeners to respond to user interactions.
